## A student

* Actually, a *professional* studnet â˜º
* Graduated, worked for a few years, then decided that he didn't like it and went back to school.
* Currently focusing on performance analysis for supercomputers, he really really REALLY want to graduate with a PhD in a few years.
* After that, it will be time to seek another educational, *pseudo-student* position somewhere. Wish me luck!

## A worker

* Supporter of activities that involve education, charity, dancing, alcohol, science, creative expressions, and technology... in no specific order.
* Will work for food, a lot of food.

## A time waster

* Allocates time to be wasted reading books; listening to music; and watching movies, tv shows, animation, and basically anything that was made to be watched.
* Always open to wasting time in the company of other people.
